# Queues

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO** (First In First Out) principle.

## Characteristics

- Elements are added from the **rear** and removed from the **front**.
- Used in scheduling, buffering, and task queues.

## Common Operations

- `enqueue()`: Add an item to the queue.
- `dequeue()`: Remove the front item.
- `peek()`: View the front item.
- `is_empty()`: Check if the queue is empty.
