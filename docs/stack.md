# Stacks

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO** (Last In First Out) principle.

## Characteristics

- Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the **top**.
- Useful for undo operations, expression evaluation, and more.

## Common Operations

- `push()`: Add an item to the stack.
- `pop()`: Remove the top item.
- `peek()`: View the top item without removing it.
- `is_empty()`: Check if the stack is empty.
